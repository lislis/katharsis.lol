export default `<h2>General notes</h2>
            <p>The following notes refer to the Katharsis.lol software only.</p>
            <p>Katharsis.lol is Free Software and can be hosted by any person.<br>Hosting also encompasses further components (e.g. a web server) that are in the care of the hoster or the administrator (used interchangably here) and that at this point we cannot make any statements about. Further notes on data protection specific to the hoster <a href="#data-hoster">are linked further down</a>.<br>It's worth checking them out!</p>
            <h2>Usage as spectator</h2>
            <p>There is no data being collected while watching and reading a performance from the spectator's room. Watching happens anonymously.</p>

            <h2>Usage as participant</h2>
            <p>To participate in a performance of Katharsis.lol you need a nickname and a ticket code.</p>
            <p>It is explicitly desired to <strong>not</strong> use your real name but a pseudonym as your nickname.<br>
              The nickname will be saved to the database as a part of the performance and to your browser's local storage.<br>Through "Leaving" the performance you empty the local storage, the database is being emptied after the performance.<br>Administrators have the possibility to export a performance in the JSON data format and use it later if applicable. Here, your nickname will also appear.</p>
            <p>Ticket codes are generated randomly and entirely unaware of real people.<br>The decision who receives which codes happens through the administrators outside of Katharsis.lol.<br>Only on entering a performance the code and your nickname are set into relation for verification purposes.<br>Ticket codes are deleted after a performance.</p>`
